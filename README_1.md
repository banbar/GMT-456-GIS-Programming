# GMT 456 GIS Programming
This repository contains sample data, information and code about the "GMT 456 GIS Programming" course offered at the Geomatics Engineering Dept. of Hacettepe University, Turkey.

The **aim** of this course is to teach students how to collaborate on a software project involving spatial analysis by using git.   

The **successful students** would: 
* ***Describe*** the Software Design Life Cycle (SDLC) phases,
* ***Document*** the design and requirements of the software project that s/he worked on, 
* ***Demonstrate*** the ability to work as a team for the purpose of developing a new or updating an existing QGIS plugin.

## Contents:
* Object oriented programming - recap
   * Function Calls – pass by reference vs pass by value
* Data structures (arrays, linked lists, graphs) - recap 
* Qt Designer
   * Signal- Slot
* Google Earth Engine
* Building a QGIS Plugin

## Assignment 1 (deadline: 16 Oct):
You will be submitting your README.md files on the comparison of different SDLC methodologies to this address:
